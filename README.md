# Email Sender using python and Excel data

Using this project, we can send bulk mails to users using "Excel data" with a single clique.<br/>
If you are new to python you should install python and all the required packages to run this project.

## Points to be remembered while working with this:
1. You should have proper Internet Connection.
2. you have to create a app password using your own gamil account.
3. Excel data should not contain Empty data, otherwise it will throw some error even though mail will be sent successfully.
